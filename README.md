Getting comfortable with android wear

This app allows you to start a playlist via Wear Device by the command "play <song> by <artist>". 

The mobile part of the app uses Echonest & Spotify APIs to retrieve the seed song and construct a playlist based off of similar artists.

Eventually, it will use the user's heart rate as a tempo parameter for the songs
